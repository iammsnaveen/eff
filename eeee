I am pleased to share the latest update on our SDH automation initiatives.

Summary Highlights:

Total automation scripts now deprecated due to UI changes: 123 scripts
Total planned test cases for automation: 206 scripts
Total bugs identified during automation: 12
Effort & Savings:

I have completed the effort analysis based on executing test scripts once daily over a 5-day workweek. The key points are:

Total manual effort saved per week: approximately 600 minutes (~10 hours)
Average efficiency gain by automation: over 85% across features
Weekly effort saved: ~10 hours, freeing manual testing resources to focus on other critical tasks
Additional notes:

The automation framework is successfully integrated with the CI pipeline, ensuring continuous testing and quick feedback.
The effort saved translates into faster release cycles and improved testing efficiency.
Please let me know if you'd like a detailed report or further insights.
