Hi Team,

As discussed, please find the  automation plan for the SDH Super Table modules. We've set the project start date to Monday, May 19, 2025, and refined our estimates to account for completing 2 medium complexity test cases per day.

This plan also includes estimated timelines for 1, 2, and 3 resources, 


These estimates include effort for:

Shadow DOM handling using Selenium 4 with JavaScript executors or shadowRoot traversal.
Verification of UI against API responses for required test cases.

ummary of Total Duration (including 10% buffer):

1 Resource: Approximately 27.4 weeks, estimating completion in late November / early December 2025.
2 Resources: Approximately 13.8 weeks, estimating completion around late August 2025.
3 Resources: Approximately 9.2 weeks, estimating completion around late July 2025.

Here's a more compact version of the "Automation Steps & Key Considerations" section, focusing on conciseness while retaining all essential information:

Automation Steps & Key Considerations
Our automation approach for the SDH Super Table modules will involve:

Planning & Design:

Feasibility analysis of manual test cases for automation.
Script design and documentation, including identifying reusable components.
Environment Setup:

Selenium 4 framework configuration and dependency management.
Setting up test data environments (e.g., databases, API mocks).
Framework Development & Enhancements:

Robust Shadow DOM handling: This is critical for finding web elements within Shadow DOM. We'll utilize Selenium 4's shadowRoot traversal capabilities and JavaScript executors for dynamic scenarios.
Angular waits and synchronization: Implementing mechanisms like ExpectedConditions.angularReady() to ensure test stability with Angular's asynchronous behavior.
Modular test script development: Employing Page Object Models (POM) or component-based models for maintainability and reusability.
Script Development & Implementation:

Writing automation scripts based on designed test cases.
Implementing a data-driven approach (Excel/JSON) for dynamic content.
Integrating API calls for UI verification to ensure data consistency between UI and backend.
Execution & Reporting:

Setting up test execution pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD).
Configuring detailed reporting for test results.
Maintenance:

Regularly reviewing and updating scripts to adapt to application changes and perform periodic regression cycles.
